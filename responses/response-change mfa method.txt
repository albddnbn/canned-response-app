change mfa method

Hi $owner,


To change the phone number used for MFA for your account, you can go to https://office.com, and login with your Delaware Tech credentials. Then, click your name or profile picture in the top right of the page, and select "View Account".

Next, there will be some 'tiles' in the center of the page. Please click on the "Update Info" option inside the "Security" tile. 

This should bring you to the page where you can add, edit, or remove any of your Authentication methods, as well as set the Default Authentication method.
If you don't have access to your account, please call our collegewide IT Help Desk line at 302-857-1700. We'll have to verify your identity before making the changes to your account.
You can also visit our Virtual Technical Support Center via https://support.dtcc.edu, or come to campus in person with your student ID.
I apologize for any inconvenience, MFA was implemented recently in order to increase individual user account security at Delaware Tech.
